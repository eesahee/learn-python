“Do you know the hallmark of a second rater? It's resentment of another man's
achievement. Those touchy mediocrities who sit trembling lest someone's work
prove greater than their own - they have no inkling of the loneliness that
comes when you reach the top. The loneliness for an equal - for a mind to
respect and an achievement to admire. They bare their teeth at you from out
of their rat holes, thinking that you take pleasure in letting your brilliance
dim them - while you'd give a year of my life to see a flicker of talent
anywhere among them. They envy achievement, and their dream of greatness is
a world where all men have become their acknowledged inferiors.
They don't know that that dream is the infallible proof of mediocrity,
because that sort of world is what the man of achievement would not be able
to bear. They have no way of knowing what he feels when surrounded by
inferiors - hatred? no, not hatred, but boredom - the terrible, hopeless,
draining, paralyzing boredom. Of what account are praise and adulation
from men whom you don't respect? Have you ever felt the longing for
someone you could admire? For something, not to look down at, but up to?"
"I've felt it all my life," she said.”
― Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged
